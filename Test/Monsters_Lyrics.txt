I see your monsters
I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I'll chase them away
I'll be your lighthouse
I'll make it okay
When I see your monsters
I'll stand there so brave
And chase them all away
A cup of coffee still steaming
Staring back at me, it's blacker than the night
Ay, I'm awake but still sleeping
I keep telling myself I'll be alright (I won't)
And I know it can't get worse than today
Sitting here and she's trying to rehearse what to say
See, she's in the bathroom hoping I'm not in earshot
While she's getting used
To the sound of a teardrop, splash it hits the tile
And I know it's been a while since you seen me
Smile and laugh like I used to
I've been in denial since it happened
Just take me to the past
'Cause I just can't imagine losing you (too)
I can't explain this so I'll keep it all inside
Wear my pain, but it's masked by my pride
She came to hold me and she cried
Told me this as she stared into my eyes, said
I see your monsters
I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I'll chase them away
I'll be your lighthouse
I'll make it okay
When I see your monsters
I'll stand there so brave
And chase them all away
I can't, you won't like what you see
If you were in my head and had to hear my pleas
It's like I can't believe this is happening to me
And could someone please
Shut this fucking answering machine
So I can start leaving these messages
That you will never get
And all these cries for help
You'll never see and never check
But I guess it's easy for you to leave me
But believe me
See this isn't something that Ima just forget
I would trade it all for one more minute
Don't you see I really need you to talk to
I'm still sitting here wondering who did it
While I'm staring out our front door
Knowing you'll never walk through
Said you'd come right back
And now you're gone like that
A blank stare as I stand so alone
And know you're never coming home (damn)
I see your monsters
I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I'll chase them away
I'll be your lighthouse
I'll make it okay (yeah)
When I see your monsters
I'll stand there so brave
And chase them all away
I got a heart made of fool's gold
Got me feeling so cold
You keep chipping away
All the promises that I told
Felt like I was on those
They keep slipping away
I want nobody else
But it's hard to get to know me
When I don't know myself
And it helps 'cause I felt
I was down, I was out
Then you looked at me now
And said I see your monsters
I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I'll chase them away
I'll be your lighthouse
I'll make it okay
When I see your monsters
I'll stand there so brave
I see your monsters
I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I'll chase them away (chase them all away)
I'll be your lighthouse
I'll make it okay (make it okay)
When I see your monsters
(When I see your monsters)
I'll stand there so brave
And chase them all away
